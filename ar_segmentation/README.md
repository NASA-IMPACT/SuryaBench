# Binary Map Creator for Active Regions with Polarity Inversion Lines

This project provides C++ and Python tools to generate:

1. **Binary maps** representing strong solar Active Regions (ARs) that contain Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs)
2. **Index files** indicating the locations of input FITS files and output HDF5 results

---

## Project Structure

The following files need to be modified based on your environment and data locations:

- `./scripts/fulldisklist.txt`  
  Specify the years and months for which you want to create binary maps.

- `config.yaml`  
  Update the `data_dir` field to point to the directory containing magnetogram files (FITS format).

- `./index_file/ar_index_creator.py`  
  Update the `file_path` variable to match the directory containing the generated binary maps (HDF5 format) created by SuryaBench.

## Usage
### 0. **Build and Run Using Docker**
You can either install dependencies locally or use a Docker container.

Run the Docker container (with GPU support and volume mount):
```bash
docker build -t SuryaBench -f docker/dockerfile .
docker run --gpus all -it \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/data \
  --name SuryaBench_ar_seg \
  SuryaBench
```

Re-enter the running container (if it was stopped):
```bash
docker start SuryaBench_ar_seg
docker exec -it SuryaBench_ar_seg /bin/bash
```

Once inside the container, you can build and run the code as described in the steps below.

### 1. **Build the Project (CMake)**
```bash
cmake build .
cd build
make
```
### 2. Run the code
The program runs based on a HARP number (e.g., year and month), which corresponds to a folder containing input FITS files:
```bash
./SuryaBench 20220101
```

### 3. Using the Bash Script (rocommended)
You can run the full pipeline using the provided script:
```bash
./scripts/main_code_runner.sh
```

### 4. Generate Index Files
```bash
python ./index_file/ar_index_creator.py
```
